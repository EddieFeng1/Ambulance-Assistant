# Ambulance-Assistant
Hi there. This a website application based on Leaflet which aims to address the need for a user-friendly and interactive platform for visualizing hospital locations in England. By leveraging modern web technologies, we have created a dynamic mapping application that allows users to explore and interact with spatial data related to healthcare facilities. Ambulance Assistant could help people in an emergency get prompt treatment and save ambulance service time to help the next patient.

# Technologies used
My project utilizes a combination of front-end and back-end technologies to deliver a seamless user experience. The key technologies employed include:
1.	Leafet@1.0.3: an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.
2.	Leaflat-routing-machine@lastest: Leaflet Routing Machine is an easy, flexible and extensible way to add routing to a Leaflet map. Using the default is just a few lines of code to add fully functional routing, but you can still customize almost every aspect of the user interface and interactions.
3.	HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Fundamental web technologies for building the user interface and adding interactivity.
4.	jQuery AJAX@1.7.2: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Fundamental web technologies for building the user interface and adding interactivity.
5.	pgAdmin III: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Fundamental web technologies for building the user interface and adding interactivity.
6.	FileZilla: an FTP program for file uploading and downloading to and from your FTP site, server, or host. The program lets you transfer files and navigate among folders, Web sites, and your computer. This software enables you to perform multiple file transfers simultaneously.

# Objectives
The main objectives include:
1.	To help patients/ ambulance drivers navigate to the closest hospital they are located in. 
2.	To enable users to search for hospitals by name and visualize their locations on the map.
3.	To provide a comprehensive map-based interface for displaying all hospitals in England.
4.	To raise awareness of the high pressure of medical needs NHS is under.

# There are may some further updates and new functions in the future.
